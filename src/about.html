                Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Zandeli. I am originally from South Africa but moved to Australia, North Sydney to live my dream. I am currently a student at Coder Academy learning to become a full stack web developer and achieve
                a Diploma in Information Technology. So did I mention I’m living and learning the dream?
            </p>
            <p>During my younger years I was mostly interested in Finance and have pictured myself in the corporate world plenty of times. So I went on to get my Bachelor of Commerce degree in Financial Accounting at Stellenbosch University. It is to no
                surprise that I’m currently learning how to program as I have always had a great passion for computers and technology. Leaving my home country to study abroad, a field that I had little working knowledge in but an immense passion for,
                is a perfectly painted picture of my character. I code with confidence knowing that the developer community is one of the safest, kindest, motivational and inspirational groups of people I’ve been introduced to.</p>

            <p>Some of my other interests include music, dancing and cooking. I enjoy living a healthy active lifestyle therefor I’m always on the search for a new nutritional recipe to try. It is important for me to take time out of my schedule to exercise
                which could include, but is not limited to, going for walks, running, going to the gym or going some yoga. I adore animals and have always had the privilege of having pets in the house. I regard myself as being a classic metropolitan,
                street-style owner, glamour-lover fashion enthusiast. I have great appreciation for classy style, modern contemporary art, fine music and a good cappuccino.
            </p>
            <p>To view my projects and skills, please visit the projects page or download my resume below. Feel free to contact me on my contact page or visit the links below to follow my coding journey! </p>
